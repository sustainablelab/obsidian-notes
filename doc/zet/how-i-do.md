# Rename an internal link

I use internal links `[[like-this]]` as nodes to define
connections. These are empty files.

To rename the link:

- click on the node in graph view
    - this creates a file
    - the file is opened in a new pane
- edit the file title
    - this updates all internal links
- delete the file
- close the pane
