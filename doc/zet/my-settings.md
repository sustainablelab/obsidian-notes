# Forces

First:

- *Link force:* max
- *Link distance:* min

Then keep `Center force` and `Repel force` about equal with
`Center force` a little stronger.

- Sliding this pair towards stronger/weaker, the "islands" move
  closer/further apart.
    - typical use: go as weak as possible while the text is still
      visible
    - temporary birds-eye view: go weaker than that
