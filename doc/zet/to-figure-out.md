How do I set up my Obsidian vault to behave like the
three-pane vault template here:
https://help.obsidian.md/Start+here

Specifically, I like the behavior of the three panes:

- there's a vault-wide toc on left
- there's a local graph and local toc on right
- whatever I click, it loads into the middle pane
